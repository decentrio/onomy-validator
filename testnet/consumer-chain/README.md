## Setup Instruction

### **1. Building the provider binary**

To build the binary from source, run these commands:
```bash
mkdir $HOME/go/bin # ignore this command if you already have $HOME/go/bin folder
export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/go/bin
cd $HOME
git clone https://github.com/onomyprotocol/onomy
cd onomy
git checkout v5.0.0 # Using v5.0.0
make install
onomyd version # v5.0.0
```

### 2. Joining Onomy provider chain
Here is a full script to init and run the provider chain with state sync. This script should be run with administration priviledges by running `sudo bash script.sh`:

```bash
onomyd init <moniker> --chain-id <chain-id>
cd $HOME/.onomy
wget  -O config/genesis.json

# state sync
SNAP_RPC=""
LATEST_HEIGHT=$(curl -s $SNAP_RPC/block | jq -r .result.block.header.height); \
BLOCK_HEIGHT=$((LATEST_HEIGHT - 2000)); \
TRUST_HASH=$(curl -s "$SNAP_RPC/block?height=$BLOCK_HEIGHT" | jq -r .result.block_id.hash)
sed -i.bak -E "s|^(enable[[:space:]]+=[[:space:]]+).*$|\1true| ; \
s|^(rpc_servers[[:space:]]+=[[:space:]]+).*$|\1\"$SNAP_RPC,$SNAP_RPC\"| ; \
s|^(trust_height[[:space:]]+=[[:space:]]+).*$|\1$BLOCK_HEIGHT| ; \
s|^(trust_hash[[:space:]]+=[[:space:]]+).*$|\1\"$TRUST_HASH\"|" $HOME/.onomy/config/config.toml

# run node
onomyd start --p2p.seeds 
```

### 3. Join provider as a validator
To join `<chain-id>` as a validator, you should setup a running node as in **[step 1](#2-joining-onomy-provider-chain)** above and wait for it to be fully synced, and then setup validator:
- Create a key:
    ```bash
    onomyd keys add <validator-key> # generate a new key, or use `--recover` to recover an existed key with mnemonic
    ```
- For testnet tokens, head to `<faucet-channel>` [channel]() on the Onomy discord and send the following message with you address included
    ```
    $request <address> <chain-id>
    ```
- To see the current amount of the address, use:
    ```
    $balance <address> <chain-id>
    ```
- Create validator:
    ```bash
    onomyd tx staking create-validator --amount=1000000000000anom --moniker="<validator-name>" --chain-id=<chain-id> --commission-rate="0.05"  --commission-max-change-rate="0.01" --commission-max-rate="0.20" --from=<validator-key> --node=<rpc> --gas=auto --min-self-delegation 10 --pubkey=$(onomyd tendermint show-validator)
    ```

- If you want to add validator info:
    ```bash
    onomyd tx staking edit-validator \
        --website="" \ # URL to validator website
        --identity="" \ # keybase.io identity 
        --details="" \ # Additional detail 
        --security-contact="" \ # security email
        --from=<validator-key> \
        --node=<rpc>
    ```

### 4. Setup chain-id
The validator also need to setup the `chain-id` consumer chain. Here is the commands to install the binary and setup new chain.
```bash
# detail of setup will appear here
```

The validators **MUST NOT** run the node but wait until the new genesis is published on Onomy testnet, which will be detailed in step **[5. Vote the cosumer addition proposal](#5-vote-the-cosumer-addition-proposal)**.

### 5. Vote the cosumer addition proposal
The proposal of launching <chain-id> as consumer chain will be submitted on Onomy provider chain, and the validators should partivipate in voting the proposal. After the proposal is passed, the validators should wait until the `spawn_time` and replace the old genesis file with the new `genesis-with-ccv.json` file from Onomy testnet repo.

```bash
wget -O /$HOME/.onomy/config/genesis.json <url>
```

### 6. Wait for genesis and run

At the genesis time, validators can start the cosumer chain by running
```bash
onomyd start
```
